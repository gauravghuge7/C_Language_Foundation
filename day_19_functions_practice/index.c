question 1 --> create a function and receive a number h and print the factorial of h and also return the factorial 

factorial  h = 4

factorial of h =  1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 is the factorial of 4

use loop from (1 to h)

question 2 --> create a function and receive two number a and b print the highest common factor 

use loop from bigger number to 0
use if else 



question 3 --> create a function recieve a number b and print the numbers from  b to 1
